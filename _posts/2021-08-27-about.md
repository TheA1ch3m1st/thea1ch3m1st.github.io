## Description

This is the README/About page for this project.

## Who am I?

My name is Alchemist. I'm 14 years old and I'm from the Middle East. I am an aspiring penetration tester and security researcher, and I have a passion for breaking things and figuring out how they work.

## My Blog

This is a blog site that was made using a GitHub Pages theme called Hacker. The site wasn't made from scratch because A) I was in a time crunch but mostly because B) Jekyll made adding new posts to the blog very easy.

Most of the posts you can find here are written by me, but here and there, you can find contributions made by my peers.
